# Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO
##### ALGORITHMS QUEUES STACK DATA-STRUCTURES <br>
## Learning Objectives <br>
1. What do LIFO and FIFO mean
LIFO - Last In First Out (Implementation of insertion and deletion in stacks)
FIFO - First In First Out (Implementation of insertion and Deletion in queues)
2. What is a stack, and when to use it
Can be implemented using arrays (statically) or linked lists (dynamically)
3. What is a queue, and when to use it
Queue is implemented using arrays (statically) or linked lists (dynamically)
4. What are the common implementations of stacks and queues
Common operations include: Insertion, Deletion, Display
5. What are the most common use cases of stacks and queues
Stacks are used when number reversal, back-tracking (problem solving in maze problems) <br>
and in depth-first search algorithm
6. What is the proper way to use global variables
Using the extern keyword before the variable name
